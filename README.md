# Donor Assistant (blood donation)
In order to shorten the waiting time before the blood donation in a meaningful way, Pepper is supposed to greet the donor at the reception and perhaps engage him or her in an interaction.
If Pepper recognises a person, it addresses him or her and charmingly invites him or her to talk. Subsequently, the donor could be offered different areas of communication, which on the one hand are reproduced linguistically, but also in the display on the monitor. Depending on the effort, the knowledge transfer can take place by means of communication (question/answer) or a pure presentation.
## The following areas are suitable in terms of content:
- Blood donation -> from donation to product
- Digitalisation in blood donation "My Blood" app including the digital health questionnaire
o QR code for downloading the app can be displayed.
o Where and when is the next blood donation event?
o (later) appointment booking
o Information on current topics?
- Blood and blood products including background information on the Blood Centre Linz.
o "Can you tell me your blood group?", "0 negative", "Oh, good that you are here today; we need it urgently. We can supply the Upper Austrian hospitals with it for another week."
- Knowledge quiz (Possible areas: Blood, blood donation / guessing numbers - preserves per year...).
Everything is conceivable in the interaction:
- Language and image combined.
- Symbolic representation that can be selected on the monitor <br>

Whereby the prompt via speech would have the best effect, since the attention of bystanders can also be gained.
When defining the menu navigation or the contents, it would be helpful to use a simple mark-up language such as YAML or similar, so that the contents can be exchanged without programming in the best case. On the one hand, this approach would allow interaction models to be exchanged and tested in a simple way, and on the other hand, customers could be offered the opportunity to update content or include current and new topics.
Perhaps this would also create the possibility of using Pepper in other areas besides blood donation, e.g. in the Youth Red Cross.
